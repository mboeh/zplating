# zplating

WIP parser for ZPL files in Go. Eventual goal is to support some subset of ZPL for rendering to PNG. All that is currently implemented is a pretty printer.

## Dev Notes

- I wish Go had enums and/or sum types.
  - I wish Go had exhaustiveness checking for `switch`.
- I wish Go had string literal types like TypeScript.
